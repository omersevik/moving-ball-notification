# 🟢 Moving Ball with Notification

A simple and interactive web application where a ball moves vertically across the screen.  
Hovering over the ball pauses its movement and reveals a smooth notification box.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Continuous up-and-down ball animation
- 🖱️ Hover to pause the ball
- 💬 Notification message appears on hover
- 🌐 Lightweight and responsive design
- ⚙️ Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Markup structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and animation  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Interaction and logic

## 🎮 How It Works

The ball moves vertically on the right side of the screen using JavaScript-based animation.  
When the user **hovers over the ball**, the animation **pauses** and a **notification box** appears with a message.  
When the cursor leaves the ball, the animation resumes and the notification disappears.
